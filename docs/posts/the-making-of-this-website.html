      <p>Part of the idea of making my own website and using it as an opportunity to create my own tools for doing it, was also so that I could write about it. I am now in a position where I can add a MD file to the posts folder, run the build script and have it generate the HTML for the pages. I think this is a good point to reflect on what I have done so far.</p>
<p>Before I get stuck in, I just wanted to mention the unescapable topic that is AI. As an engineer I have found it interesting to use tools such as <a href="https://cursor.com/en">Cursor</a> and <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a>. I have learned so much using them and I have found that the conversational approach to learning has really helped me clarify certain concepts that I was trying to grasp. It&#39;s probably something that deserves its own dedicated post, but I just wanted to mention that I have leaned on these tools, particularly for writing the scripts to build and serve the website locally. The reason I mention it is because I have actually found that it encourages me to do more rather than less. Where in the past I may have thought, I&#39;ll pick a library to acheive something, I&#39;m finding that I give it a go myself, which is why I guess I&#39;m trying to build a SSG in the first place. </p>
<p>To start with I&#39;ll describe my current workflow for adding a new post. The first step is to create a MD file in the <a href="https://github.com/pdp2/hi/tree/e676a82f5251cda1b254d91baf9fb7ee3f7128be/posts">posts directory</a>.</p>
<aside data-type="note">
  You will notice that GitHub links I provide include a specific commit SHA. I chose this way to guarantee that the file or folder I am pointing to actually exists. This would not be the same if I pointed to the main branch because it could get out of date, whereas I can guarantee that the reference existed at a specific commit.
