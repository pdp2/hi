      Redesign exploration with Cursor

      <p>I have been getting a bit bored of the design for my website and I thought it would be a good opportunity to see how Cursor would deal with a design challenge using the Opus 4.5 model.</p>
<p>I gave it the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m kind of bored of the look and feel of this website.</p>
<p>Can you review the code and come up with a new design.</p>
<p>Here are some example websites I like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chenhuijing.com">https://chenhuijing.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jessicahische.is/awesome">https://jessicahische.is/awesome</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://sallylait.com">https://sallylait.com</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the first design was truly repulsive, within a minute or two, Cursor had rebuilt my website with a completely new design as shown in <a href="/dark-brown-version.html">this page</a> and the screengrab below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screengrab-dark-brown-design.jpg" alt="A screengrab of the dark brown design" title="A screengrab of the dark brown design"></p>
<p>I threw another prompt at it to generate another design idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool that&#39;s a nice option. I have commited that so we have a snapshot of that design. Can you generate another variation?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another website I like:
<a href="https://www.cassie.codes/">https://www.cassie.codes/</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next attempt was actually quite nice and more along the lines of the whimsical effect I was going for. Here is <a href="/whimsical-version.html">the page</a> and the screengrab below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screengrab-whimsical-design.jpg" alt="A screengrab of the whimsical design" title="A screengrab of the whimsical design"></p>
<p>There were already a few ideas that I liked from these iterations, but I asked for another one for good measure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That was really cool! I just want one more idea so that I can pick the best parts of all three.</p>
<p>Can you get some inspiration from this website for the next one:
<a href="https://www.windowsofnewyork.com/">https://www.windowsofnewyork.com/</a> </p>
<p>But keep the whimsical traits from the previous iterations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="/elegant-version.html">the page</a> for the last iteration and the screengrab below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screengrab-elegant-design.jpg" alt="A screengrab of the elegant design" title="A screengrab of the elegant design"></p>
<p>This was the first time I have used Cursor to try out some UI design ideas. In my day-to-day work, I&#39;m using it to change infra settings in terraform or fixing issues with data analytics so it was quite refreshing to use it in this way and I think there are some interesting ideas here that I can use in the design for my actual website too 🙌</p>
