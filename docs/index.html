      <p>I have been getting a bit bored of the design for my website and I thought it would be a good opportunity to see how Cursor would deal with a design challenge using the Opus 4.5 model.</p>

      <p>Oh dear! It has been just over two months since my last post... That wasn&#39;t supposed to happen (or not happen).</p>
<p>I used to work with an Agile coach, who would quote &quot;Stop starting, start finishing&quot;. I&#39;m not sure who the...

      <p>I don&#39;t recall the specific search term I used, but it must have been related to productivity and organisation because I was looking for tips on how I can be more effective at work. The video I landed on was 4 Things I Did to Stop Feeling...

      <p>Part of the idea for making my own website was to use it as an opportunity to create my own tools for doing it, and also so I could write about it. I am now in a position where I can add a MD file to the posts folder, run the build script and...
