<p>This is the first post in my new blog. I am writing into a MD file, which I will later need to convert into HTML for both the entry on the home page and the separate post page. When possible, I&#39;m going to use this as an opportunity to have some fun building my own tools rather than reaching for ready made solutions.</p>
