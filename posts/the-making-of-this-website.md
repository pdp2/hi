Part of the idea of making my own website and using it as an opportunity to create my own tools for doing it, was also so that I could write about it. I am now in a position where I can add a MD file to the posts folder, run the build script and have it generate the HTML for the pages. I think this is a good point to reflect on what I have done so far.

Before I get stuck in, I just wanted to mention the unescapable topic that is AI. As an engineer I have found it interesting to use tools such as [Cursor](https://cursor.com/en) and [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/). I have learned so much using them and I have found that the conversational approach to learning has really helped me clarify certain concepts that I was trying to grasp. It's probably something that deserves its own dedicated post, but I just wanted to mention that I have leaned on these tools, particularly for writing the scripts to build and serve the website locally. The reason I mention it is because I have actually found that it encourages me to do more rather than less. Where in the past I may have thought, I'll pick a library to acheive something, I'm finding that I give it a go myself, which is why I guess I'm trying to build a SSG in the first place.
