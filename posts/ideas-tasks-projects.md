I don't recall the specific search term I used, but it must have been related to productivity and organisation because I was looking for tips on how I can be more effective at work. The video I landed on was 4 Things I Did to Stop Feeling Overwhelmed At Work by Layla at ProcessDriven.

It's easy to fall into a spiral of consuming productivity videos on YouTube resulting in being ironically unproductive. To avoid this, I decided to write a post to capture some learnings. The main takeaway was the concept of **ideas**, **tasks** and **projects**. I find this useful because it provides a way to determine if something is ready to work on, in other words, if it's a task.
